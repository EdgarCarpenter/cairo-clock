A bunch of new themes are added, which were supplied to me by people over the
last couple of weeks. Also a suggested 24h-mode is now part of cairo-clock,
thanks to Darryll Turchan for the patch. Seems like people really want this
badly, if I get a patch for this :) Still I regard a 24h-mode as strange,
because the brain is usually "conditioned" to a normal 12h-layout for analogue
clocks. Darryll also took on the effort to supply some modified versions of a
few older themes and a couple of his own creations to support the 24h-mode. At
the moment you have to select a theme with a "-24" end in its name to get a
clock-face that fits a 24h-mode. There is no "intelligence" in cairo-clock
yet to make this theme-/mode-selection automatic and transparent to the user.
