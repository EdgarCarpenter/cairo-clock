My try at producing a sleek looking analog clock you see on OS X and Vista these
days. No more pure cairo-calls. This time SVGs all the way! Drags around with
the LMB pressed, resizes with the MMB pressed. Exits on <ESC>. It has already
grown larger than I anticipated. I guess people like funky desktop visuals after
all.
